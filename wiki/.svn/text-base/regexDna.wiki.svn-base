#summary Match DNA 8-mers and substitute nucleotides for IUB codes N=500,000
#labels Not-Planned

= Rules =

We use FASTA files generated by the [fasta] benchmark as input for this benchmark. Note: the file may include both lowercase and uppercase codes.

Each program should

    * read all of a redirected FASTA format file from stdin, and record the sequence length
    * use the same simple regex pattern match-replace to remove FASTA sequence descriptions and all linefeed characters, and record the sequence length
    * use the same simple regex patterns, representing DNA 8-mers and their reverse complement (with a wildcard in one position), and (one pattern at a time) count matches in the redirected file
    * write the regex pattern and count
    * use the same simple regex patterns to make IUB code alternatives explicit, and (one pattern at a time) match-replace the pattern in the redirect file, and record the sequence length
    * write the 3 recorded sequence lengths

Not planned, need [fasta]
