= Organization =

This wiki use one page per benchmark. The name is the same as in [http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/gp4/benchmark.php?test=all&lang=gcc&lang2=gpp shootout page] except that we transform `foo-bar` in `fooBar`.


= Discussion =

To discuss an implementation of a bench, use the comment. There is at this time no Mailing List to discuss. Use the Vala charoom [irc://irc.gimp.org/#vala] if you want.

= For Developers =

== General informations ==
*How to find work ?*
    Search the wiki with :
        * Tag := Featured
        * Words := "Not Planned"
    or click [http://code.google.com/p/vala-benchmarks/w/list?q=label:Not-Planned here]

If you want to complete some benchmarks :
    # look at the full rules on http://shootout.alioth.debian.org
    # write code
    # diff the output with a reference gived at http://shootout.alioth.debian.org
    # mail me a version and I will give you a SVN access.

== Program coding rules ==
The program must be clear and concise. It must return an integer for the status. Please abuse of the documentation.

Conserve the Makefile structure which is really simple to understand :
  * build : build all the test
  * test : diff the output with a [http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/gp4/benchmark.php?test=mandelbrot&lang=all#about standard output]
  * bench : take the benchmark
