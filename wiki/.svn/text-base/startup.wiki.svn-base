= Rules =

Each program should print "hello world" and exit.

This benchmark measures startup costs. It is run differently than the others - each program is run N times in a loop by a shell script wrapper. We show the mean CPU time. Most hello world programs are too fast for [http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/gp4/faq.php#memory the way we measure memory usage] so we only show CPU time.
