Each program should

    * "Take a permutation of {1,...,n}, for example: {4,2,1,5,3}.
    * Take the first element, here 4, and reverse the order of the first 4 elements: {5,1,2,4,3}.
    * Repeat this until the first element is a 1, so flipping won't change anything more: {3,4,2,1,5}, {2,4,3,1,5}, {4,2,3,1,5}, {1,3,2,4,5}.
    * Count the number of flips, here 5.
    * Do this for all n! permutations, and record the maximum number of flips needed for any permutation.
    * Write the first 30 permutations and the number of flips.

The conjecture is that this maximum count is approximated by n*log(n) when n goes to infinity.

FANNKUCH is an abbreviation for the German word Pfannkuchen, or pancakes, in analogy to flipping pancakes."
