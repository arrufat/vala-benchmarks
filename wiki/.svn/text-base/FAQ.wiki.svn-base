=== Have you planned to add other platforms/environments ? ===

By this time NO, all the tests are automatic and support other OS will break this easy way.

Using Mingw based binaries may also introduce false results (using cygwin will probably moreover change the results). Furthermore all the tools I use to perform automatic rendering are Unix based (look at bench.sh).

If you want you can take the C# file and make a MS VS project. I will pleasely add it to the bench (out of the automatic way).

=== Can you add the XXX language ? ===

By now, it's not my priority to add others languages, I prefer complete all the benchmarks.

If you want compare others, you can take a reference and make your own benchmark at [http://shootout.alioth.debian.org The Computer Language Benchmarks Game].

=== Why the Vala language is not supported by [http://shootout.alioth.debian.org The Computer Language Benchmarks Game] ? ===

I have asked this question on their forum and the final answer is :

You're already doing a nice job of showing benchmark measurements. Vala seems to be a new unused language, there are a lot of those and we don't show them.
