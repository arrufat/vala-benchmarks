Each program should count the prime numbers from 2 to M, using the same naïve Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm:

    * create an array of M bit flags which represent either prime or not-prime
    * for each index number
          o test the flag value at that index
                + set or clear the flag values at multiples of that index as necessary
                + if necessary keep and increment a separate count

Calculate 3 prime counts, for M = 2N × 10000, 2N-1 × 10000, and 2N-2 × 10000.

A variation on the [nsieve] benchmark with 2 differences - bit flags are used and it's acceptable to test the bit value and only flip values that need to be changed.
