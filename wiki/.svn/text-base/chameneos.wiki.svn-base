Each program should

    * create four differently coloured (blue, red, yellow, blue) concurrent chameneos creatures
    * each creature will repeatedly go to the meeting place and meet, or wait to meet, another chameneos "(at the request the caller does not know whether another chameneos is already present or not, neither if there will be one in some future)"
    * each creature will change colour to complement the colour of the chameneos that they met - don't use arithmetic to complement the colour, use if-else or switch/case or pattern-match
    * after N total meetings have taken place, any creature entering the meeting place will take on a faded colour, report the number of creatures it has met, and end
    * write the sum of reported creatures met
