#summary Read DNA sequences - write their reverse-complement N=2,500,000

= Rules =

We use the FASTA file generated by the fasta benchmark as input for this benchmark. Note: the file may include both lowercase and uppercase codes.

Each program should

    * read line-by-line a redirected FASTA format file from stdin
    * for each sequence:
          * write the id, description, and the reverse-complement sequence in FASTA format to stdout

We use these code complements:

||code||meaning||complement||
||A||A||T||
||C||C||G||
||G||G||C||
||T/U||T||A||
||M||A or C||K||
||R||A or G||Y||
||W||A or T||W||
||S||C or G||S||
||Y||C or T||R||
||K||G or T||M||
||V||A or C or G||B||
||H||A or C or T||D||
||D||A or G or T||H||
||B||C or G or T||V||
||N||G or A or T or C||N||


"by knowing the sequence of bases of one strand of DNA we immediately know the sequence of the DNA strand which will bind to it, this strand is called the reverse complement"
