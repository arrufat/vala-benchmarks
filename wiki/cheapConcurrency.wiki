#summary Send messages between linked threads N=15,000

= Rules =

Each program should create, keep alive, and send integer messages between N explicitly-linked threads. Programs may use kernel threads, lightweight threads, cooperative threadsâ€¦

Each program should :

    * create 500 threads - each thread should
          * hold and use a reference to the next thread
          * take, and increment, an integer message
          * put the incremented message on the next thread
    * N times
          * put the integer message 0 on the first thread
          * add the message taken and incremented by the last thread to a sum
    * print the sum of incremented integer messages - a count of takes
