We use FASTA files generated by the [fasta] benchmark as input for this benchmark. Note: the file may include both lowercase and uppercase codes.

Each program should

    * read line-by-line a redirected FASTA format file from stdin
    * extract DNA sequence THREE
    * define a procedure/function to update a hashtable of k-nucleotide keys and count values, for a particular reading-frame â€” even though we'll combine k-nucleotide counts for all reading-frames (grow the hashtable from a small default size)
    * write the code and percentage frequency, for all the 1-nucleotide and 2-nucleotide sequences, sorted by descending frequency and then ascending k-nucleotide key
    * count all the 3- 4- 6- 12- and 18-nucleotide sequences, and write the count and code for specific sequences
