#summary Generate and write random DNA sequences N=25,000,000
#labels Planned

= Rules =

Each program should

    * encode the expected cumulative probabilities for 2 alphabets
    * generate DNA sequences, by weighted random selection from the alphabets, using this linear congruential generator
{{{
      IM = 139968
      IA = 3877
      IC = 29573
      Seed = 42

      Random (Max)
         Seed = (Seed * IA + IC) modulo IM
         = Max * Seed / IM
}}}
    * generate DNA sequences, by copying from a given sequence
    * write 3 sequences line-by-line in FASTA format

We'll use the generated FASTA file as input for other benchmarks ([reverseComplement], [kNucleotide]).
