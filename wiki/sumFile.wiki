= Rules =

Each program should be implemented the same way as this [http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/gp4/benchmark.php?test=sumcol&lang=icon&sort=fullcpu Icon program].

The sum-file benchmark measures line-oriented I/O and string conversion.

Each program should:

    * read integers from stdin, one line at a time
    * print the sum of those integers

Programs should use built-in line-oriented I/O functions rather than custom-code. No line will exceed 128 characters, including newline. Reading one line at a time, the programs should run in constant space.
